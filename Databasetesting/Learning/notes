JDBC-download database driver and associate it with project. Every database has their driver.
Steps-
1.create connection between database and java program by Connection class.
2.generate statement/query(delete,update....) by Statement class.
3.execute the statement by particular connection by executeMethod present in Statement

select command is 2 directional.For this we need additional class ResultSet.
